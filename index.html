<b>About me</b>: 
 I am a fifth year graduate student 
at <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>. Starting on Fall 2019, I will be a Limited Term Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://research.franklin.uga.edu/agant/">University of Georgia</a>.</p><p>

My research
is primarily in algebraic geometry. In particular, I am mainly interested in geometric and arithmetic properties of moduli spaces. See my 
<a href="https://hanchangho.github.io/statement.pdf">research statement</a> for more details on my mathematical interests. </p><p>

  My graduate advisor is <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/people/HarrisJoseph.html">Joe Harris.</a> 
</p><p>

Here is my
